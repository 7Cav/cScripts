### AI Tweak (init.sqf)

Read more about how to use and change settings [here](https://github.com/7Cav/cScripts/wiki/CBA-Mission-Settings).

### Custom mission modules (Achilles)
cScripts offers a custom made module system based on Ares Mod Achilles Expansion custom mission module system.
The modules are easy to use and allow for sand-boxing as well as tools for game masters. Read more about the mission modules [here](https://github.com/7Cav/cScripts/wiki/7Cav-Modules).

### Automatic Loadout Distrubution (Poppy)
cScripts core function is [Poppy](https://github.com/BaerMitUmlaut/Poppy) a reliable, self configuring, error finding loadout framework made by [BaerMitUmlaut](https://github.com/BaerMitUmlaut). The script automatically gives all BluFor players a predefined loadout in the list below. If you have an unrecognizable loadout, you will be given the default loadout (CommonBlufor).
